**Trello**

We use our trello board to set up the next actions and inbox actions for the group to do, and assign the members to their cards, once this member has completed their card, or have worked on their card, they may add a comment or move it to the next section of the board. 

**Github**

Our github is used for our .md files, this one included, and our custom theme and any updates to our theme.

**Theme Updates**

If any theme updates are are it is built off of WP Rig, under the themes folder and the wprig-master folder, exported into the TTCMA folder via npm run bundle.

If any further changes are made to the files to update the theme, one must run "npm run bundle" in the terminal inside the wprig-master folder to export any updates to the TTCMA theme folder, and then upload the zip that is created to the website as a new theme.

**Testing**

Any testing must be done via updating the staging site, to check for any mishaps or errors on a live server before pushing to the production site.
